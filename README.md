# README

Blog of a home-education project with Johanna (18) and Jonathan (15).

While I try to put a lot of detail in the write-ups, they are not as detailed as a textbook or lecture notes. But if you happen to come by here and have a look at the material, I would love to hear from you. 

The sessions are based on using programming for mathematics. If you would like to see introductions based on video games try [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/408463938/editor) or [Khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming).
