</p><h1>                  Fibonacci Numbers and Nature
</h1>

This page has been split into TWO PARTS.  <p>
This, the <b>first</b>, looks at the Fibonacci
numbers and why they appear in various "family trees" and patterns of spirals
of leaves and seeds.</p><p>
The second page then examines why the golden section is used by nature in some  
detail, including animations of growing plants.

<h2 id="section1">1                   Rabbits, Cows and Bees Family Trees
</h2>
Let's look first at the Rabbit Puzzle that Fibonacci wrote about and then at two
adaptations of it to make it more realistic.  This introduces you to the Fibonacci Number
series and the simple definition of the whole never-ending series.

<a id="Rabbits"></a>
<h3 id="section1.1">1.1
                                Fibonacci's Rabbits
</h3>

The original problem that Fibonacci investigated (in the year
1202) was about how fast rabbits could breed in ideal circumstances.


<p><img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/manyrab.gif" alt="Fluffy bunnies" width="225" hspace="20" height="161" align="left">
</p>

<p>Suppose a newly-born pair of rabbits, one male, one female, are
put in a field. Rabbits are able to mate at the age of one month so that
at the end of its second month a female can produce another pair of
rabbits. Suppose that our rabbits <b>never die</b> and that
the female <b>always</b> produces one new pair (one male,
one female) <b>every month</b> from the second month on.  
The puzzle that Fibonacci posed was...
</p>

<p>How many pairs will there be in one year?<br clear="all">

</p>

<ol>
   <li>At the end of the first month, they mate, but there is still
   one only 1 pair.</li>
   
   <li>At the end of the second month the female produces a new pair,
   so now there are 2 pairs of rabbits in the field.</li>
   
   <li>At the end of the third month, the original female produces a
   second pair, making 3 pairs in all in the field.</li>
   
   <li>At the end of the fourth month, the original female has
   produced yet another new pair, the female born two months ago
   produces her first pair also, making 5 pairs.</li>
</ol>
<div align="center">
<p><img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/fibrab.gif" alt="Fluffy bunnies family tree" width="442" hspace="15" height="371"><br>

<a id="fibwhy"></a>
<br>
The number of pairs of rabbits in the field at the start of each month is
     1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
</p></div>

<p>Can you see how the series is formed and how it continues? If not,
look at <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibseries.html">the answer</a>!

<p>The <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibtable.html">first 300 Fibonacci

<p>Now can you see <b>why</b> this is the answer to our
Rabbits problem? If not,

</td></tr></tbody></table>
Both diagrams above represent the same information.  Rabbits have been numbered to enable
comparisons and to count them, as follows:
<ul>
<li>All the rabbits born in the same month  are of the same generation and
 are on the same level in the tree. </li>
<li> The rabbits have been uniquely numbered so that in the same generation 
the new rabbits are numbered in the order of their parent's number. 
Thus 5, 6 and 7 are the children of 
0, 1 and 2 respectively.</li>
<li> The rabbits labelled with a Fibonacci number are the 
  children of the original rabbit (0) at the top of the tree.</li>
<li> There are a Fibonacci number of new rabbits in each generation, marked with a dot.</li>
<li> There are a Fibonacci number of rabbits in total from the top down to any
  single generation.</li>
  </ul>
There are many other interesting mathematical properties of this tree that are explored in later pages
at this site.

<a id="realrab"></a>
<h4 id="section1.1.1">1.1.1            The Rabbits problem is not very realistic, is it?
</h4>

<p>It seems to imply that brother and sisters mate, which,
genetically, leads to problems. We can get round this by saying that
the female of each pair mates with any male and produces another
pair.<br>
Another problem which again is not true to life, is that each birth is of
exactly two rabbits, one male and one female.<br>

</p><h3 id="section1.2">1.2  
                                Dudeney's Cows
</h3>

The English puzzlist, Henry E Dudeney (1857 - 1930, pronounced <i>Dude-knee</i>)
wrote several excellent books of puzzles (see after this section). 
In one of them he adapts Fibonacci's
Rabbits to cows, making the problem more realistic in the way we observed above.
He gets round the problems by noticing that really, 
it is only the females that are interesting - er - I mean the <i>number</i> of females!  

<p>He changes months into
years and rabbits into bulls (male) and cows (females) in problem 175 in his book
<b>536 puzzles and Curious Problems</b> (1967, Souvenir press):
<img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/cow.gif" alt="cow!" width="128" height="83" align="RIGHT">
</p><blockquote>
   If a cow produces its first she-calf at age two years and after that produces another
   single she-calf every year, how many she-calves are there after 12 years, assuming none
   die?
</blockquote>
   This is a better simplification of the problem and quite realistic now.
<p>But Fibonacci does what mathematicians often do at first,
simplify the problem and see what happens - and the series bearing
his name does have <i>lots</i> of other interesting and practical
applications as we see later. <br>
So let's look at another 
real-life situation that is exactly modelled by Fibonacci's series - honeybees.</p>

                                    Honeybees and Family trees
</h3>

<p>There are over 30,000 species of bees and in most of them the bees live
solitary lives. The one most of us know best is the honeybee and it, unusually, 
lives in a colony called a hive and they have an unusual Family Tree. In fact,
there are many unusual features of honeybees and in this section we will show
how the  Fibonacci numbers count a honeybee's  ancestors 
(in this section a "bee" will mean a "honeybee").<br>
First, some
unusual facts about honeybees such as: not all of them have two
parents!<br>

<img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/miniBee.gif" alt="bee icon" width="40" height="33" align="bottom">In a
colony of honeybees there is one special female called the
<b>queen</b>.<br>

<img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/miniBee.gif" alt="bee icon" width="40" height="33" align="bottom">
There are many <b>worker</b> bees who are female too but 
unlike the queen bee, they produce no eggs.<br>

<img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/miniBee.gif" alt="bee icon" width="40" height="33" align="bottom">
There are some <b>drone</b> bees who are male and do no work. <br>
Males are produced by the queen's unfertilised eggs, so male bees only 
have a mother but no father!<br>

<img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/miniBee.gif" alt="bee icon" width="40" height="33" align="bottom">
All the females are produced when the queen has mated with a male and so
have two parents. Females usually end up as worker bees but some are
fed with a special substance called <b>royal jelly</b> which makes
them grow into queens ready to go off to start a new colony when the
bees form a <b>swarm</b> and leave their home (a
<b>hive</b>) in search of a place to build a new nest.<br>

<img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/beeparts.GIF" alt="Bee Tree Key" width="328" height="144" align="left">

</p><p>So female bees have 2 parents, a male and a female whereas male
bees have just one parent, a female.  </p><p>
<small>
Here we follow the convention of Family Trees
that <i>parents appear above their children</i>, so the latest generations are
at the bottom and the higher up we go, the older people are.  Such trees
show all the <i>ancestors</i> (predecessors, forebears, antecedents) of the person
at the bottom of the diagram.  
We would get quite a different tree if we listed all the <i>descendants</i>
(progeny, offspring) of a person
as we did in the rabbit problem, where we showed all the descendants of the original pair.

Let's look at the family tree of a male drone bee.</p>

<ol>
   <li>He had <b>1</b> parent, a female.
   </li><li>He has <b>2</b> grand-parents, since his mother had
   two parents, a male and a female.
   </li><li>He has <b>3</b> great-grand-parents: his
   grand-mother had two parents but his grand-father had only one.
   </li><li>How many great-great-grand parents did he have?

   <li>  Make a diagram of your own family tree.  Ask your parents and grandparents and
      older relatives as each will be able to tell you
      about particular parts of your family tree that other's didn't know.
      It can be quite fun trying to see how far back you can go.  If you have them
      put old photographs of 
      relatives on a big chart of your Tree (or use photocopies of the photographs
      if your relatives want to keep the originals).  If you like, include the
       year  and place of birth and death
      and also the dates of any marriages.</li>
   <li> 
       A brother or sister is the name for someone who has the same two parents as yourself.
       What is a <i>half-brother</i> and <i>half-sister</i>?<br>
       Describe <i>a  cousin</i> but use simpler words such as <i>brother, sister,
        parent, child</i>?  <br>  
        Do the same for <i>nephew</i> and <i>niece</i>.
         What is <i>a second cousin</i>?
         What do we mean by <i>a brother-in-law, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, etc</i>?
         <i>Grand-</i> and <i>great-</i> refer to relatives <i>or your parents</i>.
         Thus a <i>grand-father</i> is a father of a parent of yours and <i>great-aunt</i>
         or <i>grand-aunt</i> is the name given to an aunt of your parent's.<p>
         Make a diagram of Family Tree Names so that "Me" is at the bottom and 
         "Mum" and "Dad" are above you.  Mark in "brother", "sister", "uncle",
         "nephew" and as many
         other names of (kinds of) relatives that you know.  It doesn't matter if you
         have no brothers or sisters or nephews as the diagram is meant to show 
          the relationships and their names.  <br>
          [If you have a friend who speaks a foreign
          language, ask them what words they use for these relationships.]
         </p></li>
   <li>  What is the name for <i>the wife of a parent's brother</i>?<br>
       Do you use a different name for the sister of your parent's?<br>
       In law these two are sometimes distinguished because one is a <i>blood relative</i>
       of yours and the other is not, just a relative through marriage. <br>
        Which do you think is the <i>blood relative</i>
       and which the relation because of marriage?
       </li>
    <li> 
        How many parents does everyone have?<br>
        So how many grand-parents will you have to make spaces for in your Family tree?<br>
        Each of them also had two parents so how many great-grand-parents of yours will
        there be in your  Tree?<br>
        ..and how many great-great-grandparents?<br>
        What is the pattern in this series of numbers?<br>
        If you go back one generation to your parents, and two to your grand-parents,
        how many entries will there be 5 generations ago in your Tree? 
        and how many 10 generations ago?<p>
        The Family Tree of humans involves a different sequence to the Fibonacci Numbers.
        What is this sequence called?</p></li>

        Looking at your answers to the previous question, your friend
        Dee Duckshun   says to you:
        <ul>
         <li> You have 2 parents. </li>
         <li> They each have two parents, so that's 4 grand-parents you've got.</li>
         <li> They also had two parents each making 8 great-grand-parents in total ...</li>
         <li> ... and 16 great-great-grand-parents ...</li>
         <li> ... and so on.</li>
         <li> So the farther back you go in your Family Tree
             the more people there are.</li>  
         <li> It is the same for 
             the Family Tree of <i>everyone</i> alive in the world today. </li>
         <li> It shows that the farther back in time we go, the more people there must have been. </li>
         <li>  So it is a logical deduction that the population of the world <i>must</i> be
             getting smaller and smaller as time goes on!</li>
         </ul>
       Is there an error in Dee's argument? If so, what is it?

                                    Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Ratio
</h2>

<p>If we take the ratio of two successive numbers in Fibonacci's
series, (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..) and we divide each by the number before it,
 we will find the following series of numbers:<br>

</p>


<sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> = 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<sup>2</sup>/<sub>1</sub> = 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> = 1·5,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<sup>5</sup>/<sub>3</sub> = 1·666...,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<sup>8</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = 1·6,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<sup>13</sup>/<sub>8</sub> = 1·625,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<sup>21</sup>/<sub>13</sub> = 1·61538...
<p>

It is easier to see what is happening if we plot the ratios on a
graph:</p>

</div>

<p>The ratio seems to be settling down to a particular value, which
we call <b>the golden ratio</b> or <b>the golden number</b>.
It has a value of approximately
<b>1·618034 </b>, 
although we shall find an even more accurate value on

   Use your

The <b>golden ratio</b> 1·618034 
is also called the <b>golden section</b> 
or the <b>golden mean</b> 
or just the <b>golden number</b>. 
It is often represented by a Greek letter <b>Phi</b> 
<img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/phi.gif" alt="phi" width="11" height="15">.  
The closely related value which we write as <b>phi</b> with a small "p"
is just the decimal part of Phi, namely 0·618034.

We can make another picture showing the Fibonacci numbers
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,.. if we start with two small squares of size 1
next to each other. On top of both of these draw a square of size 2
(=1+1).

<br clear="ALL">



</p><p>We can now draw a new square - touching both a unit square and the
latest square of side 2 - so having sides 3 units long; and then
another touching both the 2-square and the 3-square (which has sides
of 5 units). We can continue adding squares around the picture,
<b>each new square having a side which is as long as the sum of the
latest two square's sides</b>. This set of rectangles whose sides are
two successive Fibonacci numbers in length
 and which are composed of squares with sides which are 
Fibonacci numbers, we will call the
<b>Fibonacci Rectangles</b>.

Here is a spiral drawn in the squares, a quarter of a circle in each square.
The spiral is  not a <i>true</i>
mathematical spiral (since it is made up of fragments which are parts of circles and does not go on
getting smaller and smaller)
but it is a good approximation to a kind of spiral that does appear often in nature. 
Such spirals are seen in the shape of shells of snails and sea shells and, as we see later, 
in the arrangement of seeds on flowering plants too.
The spiral-in-the-squares makes a line from the centre of the spiral increase by a factor of
the golden number in each square.  So points on the spiral are 1.618 times as far from the centre
after a quarter-turn.  In a whole turn the points on a radius out from the centre
are 1.618<sup>4</sup> = 6.854 times further out than when the curve last crossed the same radial line.
</p><blockquote>
Cundy and Rollett (Mathematical Models, second edition 1961, page 70) 
say that this spiral occurs in snail-shells and flower-heads
referring to D'Arcy Thompson's <i>On Growth and Form</i> probably meaning chapter 6  "The Equiangular Spiral".  Here Thompson  is
talking about a class of spiral with a constant expansion factor along a central line and not just shells with a Phi
expansion factor.
</blockquote>

Below are images of cross-sections of a Nautilus sea shell.  They show the spiral curve 
of the shell and the internal chambers that the animal using it adds on as it grows.  The chambers provide
buoyancy in the water.  Click on the picture to enlarge it in a new window.
Draw a line  from the centre out in any direction and find two
places where the shell crosses it so that the shell spiral has gone round just once
between them.  The outer crossing point will be about 1.6 times as far from the centre as the next 
inner point on the line where the shell crosses it.
This shows that the shell has grown by a factor of the golden ratio in one turn.  <br>
On the poster shown here, this factor varies from 1.6 to 1.9 and may be due to the shell not
being cut exactly along a central plane to produce the cross-section.
<p>
Several organisations and companies have a logo based on this design, 
using the spiral of Fibonacci squares and sometime with the Nautilus shell superimposed.
It is <i>incorrect</i> to say this is a Phi-spiral.  Firstly the "spiral" is only an approximation
as it is made up of separate and distinct
quarter-circles; 
secondly the (true) spiral increases by a factor Phi every <i>quarter-turn</i>
so it is more correct to call it a Phi<sup>4</sup> spiral.<br>

<p>One plant in particular shows the Fibonacci numbers in the number
of "growing points" that it has. Suppose that when a plant puts out a
new shoot, that shoot has to grow two months before it is strong
enough to support branching. If it branches every month after that at
the growing point, we get the picture shown here.</p>

<p>A plant that grows very much like this is the "sneezewort":
Achillea ptarmica.</p>

 <b> 3 petals</b>: 
 lily, iris
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <small> Mark Taylor (Australia), a grower of Hemerocallis and Liliums 
     (lilies) points out that although these appear to have 6 
    petals as shown above, 3  are in fact <i>sepals</i> and 3 are petals.  
    Sepals form the outer protection of the flower when in bud. 
    Mark's <a href="http://www.users.on.net/~daylilies/" target="_blank">
     Barossa Daylilies  web site (opens in a new window)</a> contains many 
     flower pictures where the difference 
    between sepals and petals is clearly visible.</small>
 <br>
 <b> 4 petals </b>
   Very few plants show 4 petals (or sepals) but some, such as the fuchsia above, do.  4 is <i>not</i> a Fibonacci number!
   We return to this point near the bottom of this page.<br>
 <b> 5 petals</b>: 
 
 buttercup, wild rose, 
 larkspur, 
columbine (aquilegia), pinks (shown above)

 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <small> The humble buttercup has been bred into a multi-petalled form.</small>
 <br>
 <b> 8 petals</b>: delphiniums
 <br clear="all">
 <b>13 petals</b>: ragwort, corn marigold,  cineraria, some daisies

 <br clear="all">
 <b>21 petals</b>: 
 aster, black-eyed susan, chicory
 <br>
 <b>34 petals</b>: plantain, 
  pyrethrum
 <br>
 <b>55, 89 petals</b>: michaelmas daisies, 
 the asteraceae family.

<br clear="all">
Some species are very precise about the number of petals
they have - e.g. buttercups, but others have petals that are very near
those above, with the average being a Fibonacci number.

You can see that the orange "petals" seem to form spirals curving both to
the left and to the right. At the edge of the picture, 
if you count those spiralling to the right as you go outwards,
 there are 55 spirals. A little further towards the centre and you can  count 34 spirals.
 How many spirals go the other way at these places?
You will see that the  pair of numbers (counting spirals in curing left and curving right)
are neighbours in the Fibonacci series.

</p><p>The same happens in many seed and flower heads in nature. The reason seems to
be that this arrangement forms an <b>optimal packing</b> of the seeds 
so that, no matter how large the seed head, they are uniformly packed at any stage,
all the seeds being the same size, no crowding in the centre and not
too sparse at the edges.</p>



The spirals are patterns that the eye sees,
"curvier" spirals appearing near the centre, flatter spirals (and
more of them) appearing the farther out we go.
<p>

<i><b>So the number of spirals we see, in either direction, is different for
larger flower heads than for small. On  a large
flower head, we see  more spirals further out than we do near the centre.
The numbers of spirals in each direction are (almost always) neighbouring Fibonacci numbers!</b></i>

Click on the
image on the right for a Quicktime animation of 120 seeds appearing
from a single central growing point. Each new seed is just phi
(0·618) of a turn from the last one (or, equivalently, there are Phi
(1·618) seeds per turn). The animation shows that, no matter how big
the seed head gets, the seeds are always equally spaced. At all
stages the Fibonacci Spirals can be seen.</p>

<p>The same pattern shown by these dots (seeds) is followed if the
dots then develop into leaves or branches or petals. Each dot
only moves out directly from the central stem in a straight line.
</p>

<p>This process models what happens in nature when the "growing tip"
produces seeds in a spiral fashion. The only active area is the
growing tip - the seeds only get bigger once they have appeared.

</p><p>
[This animation was produced by Maple. If there are N seeds in one
frame, then the newest seed appears nearest the central dot, at 0·618
of a turn from the angle at which the last appeared. A seed which is
i frames "old" still keeps its original angle from the exact centre
 but will have moved out to a distance which is the square-root of i.]</p>

You will occasionally find pine cones that do not have a Fibonacci number of
spirals in one or both directions.  Sometimes this is due to deformities produced
by disease or pests but sometimes the cones look normal too. 
 This article reports on a study of this question and others in a 
 large collection of Californian pine cones of
different kinds.  The author also found that there were as many
with the steep spiral (the one with more arms) going to the left as to the right.

Also, many plants show the Fibonacci numbers in the
arrangements of the leaves around their stems. If we look down on a
plant, the leaves are often arranged so that leaves above do not hide
leaves below. This means that each gets a good share of the sunlight
and catches the most rain to channel down to the roots as it runs
down the leaf to the stem.<br>

</p><h4 id="section4.3.1" align="CENTER">4.3.1                              Leaves per turn
</h4>


<p>The Fibonacci numbers occur
when counting both the number of times we go around the stem, going
from leaf to leaf, as well as counting the leaves we meet until we
encounter a leaf directly above the starting one. 
</p><p> If we count in the
other direction, we get a different number of turns for the same
number of leaves. 
</p><p> The number of turns in each direction and the
number of leaves met are <b>three consecutive Fibonacci
numbers</b>!</p>

<p>For example, in the top plant in the picture above, we have
<b>3</b> clockwise rotations before we meet a leaf directly
above the first, passing <b>5</b> leaves on the way. If we
go anti-clockwise, we need only <b>2</b> turns. Notice that
2, 3 and 5 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.<br>

For the lower plant in the picture, we have <b>5</b>
clockwise rotations passing <b>8</b> leaves, or just
<b>3</b> rotations in the anti-clockwise direction.  This
time 3, 5 and 8 are consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.<br>

We can write this as, for the top plant, <b>3/5 clockwise
rotations per leaf</b> ( or 2/5 for the anticlockwise
direction). For the second plant it is <b>5/8 of a turn per leaf
</b> (or 3/8).</p>
<br clear="all">
The sunflower here when viewed from the top shows the same pattern. It 
is the same plant whose side view is above.
Starting at the
leaf marked "X", we find the next lower leaf turning clockwise.  
Numbering the leaves produces the patterns shown here on the right.

You will see that the third leaf  and fifth leaves are next nearest below our starting leaf 
but the next nearest below it is the 8th then the 13th.  How many turns did it take to reach each leaf?

<h3 id="section4.4">4.4                              Leaf arrangements of some common plants
</h3>

<p> One estimate is that 90 percent of all
plants exhibit this pattern of leaves involving the Fibonacci
numbers.</p>

<p>Some common trees with their Fibonacci leaf arrangement numbers
are:<br>

</p>

<blockquote>
   <tt><b>1/2 </b> elm, linden, lime, grasses<br>
   
   <b>1/3 </b> beech, hazel, grasses, blackberry<br>
   
   <b>2/5 </b> oak, cherry, apple, holly, plum, common
   groundsel<br>
   
   <b>3/8 </b> poplar, rose, pear, willow<br>
   
   <b>5/13 </b> pussy willow, almond<br>
   
   </tt>
</blockquote>

<p>where t/n means each leaf is t/n of a turn after the last leaf or that there is
there are t turns for n leaves.</p>

Cactus's spines often show the same spirals as we have already
 seen on pine cones, petals and leaf arrangements, but they are much more 
 clearly visible.

the Fibonacci numbers occur in Bromeliads and his

<div class="ttd">
<ol class="ttd"> 
 <li>Take a look at a <b> cauliflower</b> next time
   you're preparing one:
   
   <ol type="a">
      <li>First look at it:
      
      <ul>
         <li>Count the number of florets in the spirals on your cauliflower. 
           The number in one direction
         and in the other will be Fibonacci numbers, as we've seen
         here.  Do you get the same numbers as in the picture?
         </li>
         
         <li>Take a closer look at a <b>single
         floret</b> (break one off near the base of your cauliflower). 
          It is a mini cauliflower with its own little
         florets all arranged in spirals around a centre. <br>
           If you can, count the
         spirals in both directions.  How many are there?

    <li>Then, when cutting off the florets, try this:
      
      <ul>
         <li>start at the bottom and take off the
         largest floret, cutting it off parallel to the main
         "stem".
         </li>
         <li>Find the next on up the stem. It'll
         be about 0·618 of a turn round (in one direction). Cut it

         were arranged in spirals up the stem. Counting them again
         shows the Fibonacci numbers.

      <li>What about an <b>apple</b>? Instead of
      cutting it from the stalk to the opposite end (where the flower
      was), i.e. from "North pole" to "South pole", try cutting it

<p>Is this just a coincidence or not?????</p>

However, if you measure the lengths of the bones in your finger 
(best seen by slightly bending the finger)
does it look as if the ratio of the longest bone in a finger to the middle bone is
Phi? <br>
 What about the ratio of the middle bone to the shortest bone (at the end of the
finger) - Phi again?  <br>
Can you find any ratios in the lengths of the fingers that
looks like Phi?  ---or does it look as if it could be any other similar ratio
also?
<p> Why not measure your friends' hands and gather some statistics?
<br clear="ALL">
</p><blockquote>
	<b>NOTE:</b>  When this page was first created (back in 1996) this was meant as a joke and

	The idea of the lengths of finger parts being in phi ratios
	was posed in 1973 but two later articles investigating this
	both show this is false.
	<br>
	Although the Fibonacci numbers are mentioned in the title of an article in 2003,
	it is actually 
	about the golden section ratios 
	of bone lengths in the human hand,  showing that in 100 hand x-rays only
	1 in 12 could reasonably be supposed to have golden section bone-length ratios.<br>
	Research by two British doctors in 2002 looks at lengths of fingers from their rotation points
	in almost 200 hands and again fails to find to find phi (the actual ratios found were 1:1 or 1:1.3).

So it is clear that not all plants  show the Fibonacci numbers!
</p><p>
Another common series of  numbers in plants are the
<a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/lucasNbs.html">Lucas Numbers</a> that start off with 2 and 1 and then,
just like the Fibonacci numbers, have the rule that the next is the sum of the two previous ones to give:

<!--lucasHR--></p><p class="nbHR" align="center">2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521,  843 ..<a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/lucas200.html">More</a>.. <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibCalcX.html"><img src="The%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%20and%20Golden%20section%20in%20Nature%20-%201_files/calcicon.gif" alt="Calculator" width="34" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="13" border="0"></a></p>

<div class="question">Did you notice that 4, 7, 11, 18  and even 29 all occurred in the non-Fibonacci pictures above?</div>
<p>
But, no matter what two numbers we begin with, the ratio of two successive numbers in all of these
Fibonacci-type sequences always approaches a special value, the golden mean, of 1.6180339...
and this seems to be the secret behind the series.  There is more on this and how mathematics has

     Mathematical Models</a> H M Cundy and A P Rollett, (third edition, Tarquin, 1997)
     is still a good resource book
     though it talks mainly about physical models whereas today we might use computer-generated
     models.  It was one of the first mathematics books I purchased and remains one I dip into still.
     It is  an excellent resource on making 3-D models of polyhedra out of card, as well as on puzzles and how to
     construct a computer out of light bulbs and switches (no electronics!) which I  gave me more of an insight into
     how a computer can "do maths" than anything else.
     There is a wonderful section on equations of  pretty curves, some simple, some not so simple,
     that are a challenge to draw even if we do use spreadsheets to plot them now.

</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/lucasNbs.html">Lucas numbers</a> are formed in the same way as the Fibonacci
numbers - by adding the latest two to get the next, but instead of
starting at 0 and 1 [Fibonacci numbers] the Lucas number series starts with 2 and 1. 
The other two sequences Coxeter mentions above have other
pairs of starting values but then proceed with the exactly the same rule as the
Fibonacci numbers.  These series are the
<a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibGen.html">General Fibonacci series</a>.</p>

<p>An interesting fact is that for <i>all</i> series that are formed from
adding the latest two numbers to get the next starting from <i>any</i>
two values (bigger than zero), the ratio of successive terms will
<i>always</i> tend to Phi!</p>

<p>So Phi (1.618...) and her identical-decimal sister phi (0.618...) are constants common to all
varieties of  Fibonacci series and they have lots of 
<a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/propsOfPhi.html">interesting properties</a> of their own too.
